# misc
This repository contains some ad hoc scripts written on an as-you-go basis.

Current scripts 
- Prime number finder: the scripts "prime_n.py", "prime_n.R", and "prime_n.m" identify and print the first n prime numbers. These scripts are optimised to reduce the number of trials. The running time is also printed in all languages to compare execution of codes in Python vs R vs MATLAB. 
- Term structure optimiser: the script "term_optimise.R" aims to track and replicate a target series defined in the csv file "term_quotes.csv"
